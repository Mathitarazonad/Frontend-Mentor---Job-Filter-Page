### What I learned

This Project helped me to really understand more about the React library and its utility. At the first moment I thought that using simple JavaScript in this project it would be easier than using React, because I studied something about React but I didn't really understood its utility since I have put it in practice and I saw its great power.Now I can understand more about states how to use them, to pass them like props and so more.

Also I started to use the Git version control system, it was my first time, so I dedicated myself to just learning the basics like add, commit, etc.

### Continued development

For my future projects, I want to learn more about React and its tools, I heard about the useState hook but I didn't understand it and I want to implement it and my next project. Also, for my next project, I will work with class components, since functional components seems to be understood by me, I know that nowadays class components are being used yet, and I want to be able to work with both types of components.

As I said, I started to use Git, so now I want to learn more about it, about branches and that type of things. I understood that every beginner in this should learn about this, though I didn't work with a team or something like that, I saw its great utility and it was so fun learn about it since I was working in this project.
